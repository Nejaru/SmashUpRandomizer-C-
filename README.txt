This is a Randomizer application that I made for the tabletop card
game Smash Up. It randomizes which factions each player either gets,
or gets to choose from. Since it is coded using only C++, I was sort
of limited in the ways I could make it look "pretty", hence why it's
text and console only. This is a problem that I've remedied by just
starting over and making it in C#. Since moving on to C#, I've spent
less and less time updating this version.
